> A product can be manufactured in many ways, but most designers know a handful of techniques only. With specially commissioned diagrams, case studies and photographs of the manufacturing process, Making It uses contemporary design as a vehicle to describe over 120 production processes. Each process is also evaluated in terms of sustainability and its effects on the environment.

> Making It appeals to product, interior, furniture and graphic designers who need access to a range of production methods, as well as to all students of design. The expanded edition includes six new processes and a new section on joining.
